                        <h4>Description of the Services. </h4>
                        <h6>(a)  General. </h6>
                        <div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">As part of our Services, we provide a fiat-backed digital currency issuance platform (the “Platform”). The Platform provides an open infrastructure where you can issue digital representations of your fiat currency (the “Digital Currency”), and redeem your Digital Currency in return for fiat currency.  The Platform is an online environment to issue Digital Currency using corresponding fiat currency (such as issuing USDD using US dollars and RMBD using RMB) and redeem Digital Currency in exchange for the fiat currency for which it represents (such as USDD for US dollars). Digital Currency is not money, legal tender, and is not monetary instruments. Once you obtain Digital Currency, you may keep it, redeem it for fiat currency, or use it in transactions with individuals or entities who agree to accept your Digital Currency, all in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</div>
                        <h6>(b)  Digital Currency.</h6>
                        <div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Digital Currency is a digital representation of the fiat currency used to create them at issuance. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, after successfully completing the verification procedures, eligible Account Holders can purchase and redeem Digital Currency through the Platform. Fiat currency payment for the issuance and redemption of Digital Currency will be handled through escrow accounts managed by third party trust companies (“Trust Companies”). The Platform will facilitate such purchases and redemptions.</div>
                        <h6>(c)  Issuance of Digital Currency. </h6>
                        <div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">After completing the required verification procedures, you may use the Services to issue supported Digital Currency by wiring fiat funds to the Trust Companies (in accordance with wire transfer and other payment instructions provided to you at the time of the purchase transaction). After receipt of your payment, we will issue and deliver the Digital Currency to an ERC-20 wallet address that you provided. We will make best efforts to fulfill all transactions, but in the rare circumstance where we cannot fulfill your order, we will notify you and refund you the purchase payment. </div>
                        <h6>(d)  Use of Digital Currency.</h6>
                        <div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">You may use Digital Currency in transactions with people or entities who agree to accept your Digital Currency on the Platform only. You acknowledge that the Company may impose certain requirements in respect of use of Digital Currency obtained through the Services, and transacting parties must meet all applicable requirements before they can conduct transactions using the Services. Such requirements may include completion of the verification procedures set forth in Section 5.</div>
                        <h6>(e)  Redemption of Digital Currency.</h6>
                        <div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">After completing the required verification procedures, you may use the Services to redeem your Digital Currency. You will initiate the process by sending the Digital Currency to a wallet address designated by us. Upon receipt of the Digital Currency, we will instruct the Trust Companies to transfer the corresponding fiat currency payment amount to your bank account. You agree that it is your sole responsibility to verify that your bank account information is accurate and that it is capable of receiving the corresponding fiat currency payment. We will make best efforts to fulfill all transactions, but in the circumstance where we cannot fulfill your redemption order (such as when your bank rejects the payment), we will notify you and transfer the Digital Currency back to you.</div>
                        <h6>(f)  Published API. </h6>
                        <div style="margin-bottom: 10px;">As part of the Services, we will provide access to published API (the “Published API”) for real-time token and fund information disclosure. Through the Published API, users can acquire information and demonstrate bank balance and token amounts for any Digital Currency issued through the Services, with reasonable prior notice to the issuer. For greater certainty, Published API forms part of the Content. </div>
